Using many DCGAN approaches to generate anime faces

Anime faces are different than human faces in that they are 2D forms. In art, there is a different approach to painting anime faces compared to real faces.

I'm using this opportunity to learn about some basic GAN architectures, and attempting to propose my own architecture.

There's 3 things that I want to try
 1. Basic DCGAN[DONE]
 2. ProGAN[Not Done]
 3. Original model idea[coming later]
